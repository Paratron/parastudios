# Advanced Prompting Techniques for Modern Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Guide

![An abstract, AI generated image](./header.webp)

## Introduction

As a software engineer, I find it essential to master effective prompting techniques as large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 continue to evolve. This guide is my personal reference, offering a comprehensive overview of various prompting methods along with examples. My goal is to help you understand when and how to apply these techniques effectively while implementing AI in software development, with a focus on their applicability to leading models like ChatGPT and Claude.

## 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

Chain-of-Thought prompting encourages LLMs to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning processes. By asking the model to "think step by step," you can improve its performance on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning.

For more information, see the original paper: ["Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models" (Wei et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)

### Example

```
Human: Solve this word problem using step-by-step reasoning:
"If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, how far will it travel in 5 hours assuming it maintains the same speed?"

AI: Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. First, let's find the speed of the train:
   Distance = 120 miles
   Time = 2 hours
   Speed = Distance ÷ Time
   Speed = 120 miles ÷ 2 hours = 60 miles per hour

2. Now that we know the speed, we can calculate the distance for 5 hours:
   Time = 5 hours
   Speed = 60 miles per hour
   Distance = Speed × Time
   Distance = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Therefore, the train will travel 300 miles in 5 hours.
```

### Effectiveness in ChatGPT vs Claude

Both ChatGPT and Claude excel at CoT reasoning, but ChatGPT-4 often shows slightly better performance in complex mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Claude 3.5, however, can handle longer reasoning chains due to its larger context window.

## 2. Few-Shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting involves providing a small number of examples (typically 2-5) demonstrating the desired input-output format before posing your actual query. This technique helps guide the model's responses for tasks requiring specific patterns or styles.

This technique is extensively discussed in: ["Language Models are Few-Shot Learners" (Brown et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)

### Example

```
Human: I will give you three examples of classifying sentiment, then I want you to classify a new sentence.

Input: "The weather is beautiful today."
Output: Positive

Input: "I'm frustrated with this broken device."
Output: Negative

Input: "The movie was okay, nothing special."
Output: Neutral

Now classify: "I can't wait for our vacation next week!"

AI: Based on the examples provided, I would classify the sentence "I can't wait for our vacation next week!" as follows:

Output: Positive

This sentence expresses enthusiasm and excitement about an upcoming event (vacation), which indicates a positive sentiment.
```

### Effectiveness in ChatGPT vs Claude

Both models perform well with few-shot prompting. ChatGPT-4 might have a slight edge in quickly adapting to unusual or highly specific formats, while Claude 3.5 excels when the few-shot examples are more extensive due to its larger context window.

## 3. Zero-Shot and One-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting involves asking the model to perform a task without any examples, relying on its pre-trained knowledge. One-shot prompting provides a single example before the main task.

These techniques are also covered in: ["Language Models are Few-Shot Learners" (Brown et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)

### Example (Zero-Shot)

```
Human: Translate the following English sentence to French:
"The cat is sleeping on the windowsill."

AI: Here's the translation of the English sentence to French:

"Le chat dort sur le rebord de la fenêtre."
```

### Effectiveness in ChatGPT vs Claude

Both ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 perform remarkably well in zero-shot and one-shot scenarios, showcasing their ability to understand and execute tasks with minimal guidance. ChatGPT-4 might have a slight advantage in very specialized or technical domains.

## 4. Self-Consistency Prompting

This technique involves generating multiple reasoning paths for a single problem and then selecting the most consistent answer. It's particularly effective for complex problem-solving tasks where different approaches might yield varying results.

For a detailed analysis, see: ["Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models" (Wang et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171)

### Example

```
Human: Please solve the following problem using three different approaches, then determine the most consistent answer:

"In a class of 30 students, 40% are boys. If 5 more girls join the class, what percentage of the class will be boys?"

AI: I'll solve this problem using three different approaches:

Approach 1: Percentage calculation
1. Initially, there are 30 students, 40% of which are boys.
2. Number of boys = 40% of 30 = 0.4 × 30 = 12 boys
3. Number of girls = 30 - 12 = 18 girls
4. After 5 more girls join, total students = 30 + 5 = 35
5. Number of boys remains 12
6. Percentage of boys = (12 / 35) × 100 ≈ 34.29%

Approach 2: Ratio method
1. Initial ratio of boys to total: 40:100 = 2:5
2. Initial number of boys: (2/5) × 30 = 12
3. New total students: 30 + 5 = 35
4. New ratio: 12:35
5. Percentage = (12/35) × 100 ≈ 34.29%

Approach 3: Algebraic method
1. Let x be the number of boys
2. Initial equation: x / 30 = 0.4
3. Solve for x: x = 12
4. New equation: 12 / (30 + 5) = 12 / 35
5. Convert to percentage: (12/35) × 100 ≈ 34.29%

The most consistent answer across all three approaches is 34.29%. This consistency gives us confidence in the accuracy of our solution.
```

### Effectiveness in ChatGPT vs Claude

Both ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 can effectively implement self-consistency prompting. ChatGPT-4 might have a slight edge in generating diverse approaches, while Claude 3.5's larger context window allows for more extensive explanations of each approach.

## 5. Role-Playing or Instruction-Based Prompting

This technique involves assigning a specific role or persona to the LLM, guiding its tone, expertise, and perspective in responses. It's particularly useful for generating specialized content or simulating expert knowledge.

While not a specific paper, this technique is discussed in: ["Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey" (Liu et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10149)

### Example

```
Human: Act as an experienced data scientist and explain the concept of neural networks to a beginner in the field.

AI: Certainly! As an experienced data scientist, I'd be happy to explain neural networks to you in a beginner-friendly way.

Imagine your brain as a vast network of interconnected cells called neurons. These neurons communicate with each other, passing information and making decisions. Neural networks in artificial intelligence are inspired by this biological structure.

In simple terms, a neural network is a computer system designed to mimic how our brain processes information. It's made up of interconnected nodes (like our neurons) organized in layers:

1. Input Layer: This is where the network receives data, like pixels of an image or features of a dataset.

2. Hidden Layers: These intermediate layers process the information. They apply various mathematical operations to transform the input data.

3. Output Layer: This final layer provides the result, such as a classification or prediction.

The "learning" in neural networks happens by adjusting the connections (weights) between these nodes. As the network sees more data, it fine-tunes these connections to improve its accuracy.

Neural networks are powerful because they can automatically identify patterns in complex data, making them great for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and even playing complex games.

Remember, this is a simplified explanation. Neural networks can get much more complex, with various architectures and techniques, but this basic concept forms the foundation of many advanced AI systems we use today.

Does this help you understand the basic idea of neural networks? Feel free to ask if you need clarification on any part!

### Effectiveness in ChatGPT vs Claude

Both ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 excel at role-playing prompts, adapting their language and expertise convincingly. ChatGPT-4 might have a slight edge in mimicking specific writing styles or personalities, while Claude 3.5 often provides more detailed and nuanced responses in expert roles.

## 6. Contextual Prompting

Contextual prompting leverages the large context windows of modern LLMs by providing extensive background information to inform the model's responses. This technique is particularly useful for tasks requiring deep understanding of a specific topic or document.

This technique is discussed in papers like: ["What Language Model to Train if You Have One Million GPU Hours?" (Scao et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15424)

### Example

```
Human: I'm going to provide you with a passage about climate change. After reading it, I'd like you to summarize the key points and their implications.

[Insert a long passage about climate change, its causes, effects, and potential solutions]

```

### Effectiveness in ChatGPT vs Claude

Claude 3.5 has a significant advantage in contextual prompting due to its 200,000 token context window, allowing it to process and analyze much larger documents or datasets in a single prompt. While ChatGPT-4 is also capable of contextual prompting, it's more limited in the amount of context it can handle at once.

## 7. Tree of Thought (ToT)

**Tree of Thought (ToT)** is an advanced prompting technique designed to enhance the decision-making and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike linear prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which guide the model through a single, step-by-step reasoning process, ToT enables the model to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. This method draws inspiration from decision tree algorithms, where each "thought" is treated as a branch in the tree, representing an intermediate step toward solving a complex problem.

### How Tree of Thought Works

In ToT prompting, the model generates several potential "thoughts" or reasoning steps at each decision point. These branches are explored, compared, and evaluated based on their feasibility and likelihood of success. The key advantage is that ToT allows for backtracking and reconsidering of paths that initially seemed promising but lead to less optimal results. This exploration can be performed using search algorithms such as [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) or [Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search), ensuring that the model doesn’t get stuck in local optima but instead explores a wide range of potential solutions. This method is detailed in the paper ["Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models" (Yao et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601).

### Programmatic Implementation in Agentic Systems

One key distinction with ToT is that this prompting technique typically requires more than a simple direct prompt. In practical applications, ToT is usually implemented **programmatically within agentic systems**, where the LLM is invoked repeatedly. This agentic system coordinates the exploration and comparison of multiple reasoning paths. For each branch, the LLM generates a potential solution or intermediate thought, which is then evaluated externally—based on specific criteria like correctness or viability—before deciding whether to explore that branch further or prune it altogether.

This process is computationally intensive because it requires the model to evaluate multiple paths rather than a single, linear one. Therefore, it’s most effective for tasks requiring strategic exploration, such as **game-solving**, **planning**, or **creative problem-solving** in domains like finance, logistics, or medical diagnosis. This approach was highlighted in the work of Yao et al. and expanded upon in applications like creative writing and crosswords.

### Effectiveness and Use Cases

ToT excels in scenarios where the solution space is complex and where initial decisions may heavily influence the outcome. For example, in tasks like route optimization or diagnosing medical conditions, ToT allows the model to backtrack if a certain diagnosis or route proves suboptimal. By evaluating various branches of reasoning in parallel, this method helps reduce the chance of error while improving the quality of decision-making.

However, due to the computational demands and need for external coordination via an agentic system, ToT is not always the best fit for simpler or more straightforward tasks. In such cases, more direct prompting techniques like Zero-Shot or Few-Shot prompting may suffice.

By combining the depth of reasoning with strategic exploration, ToT represents a powerful tool for pushing the limits of what large language models can achieve, especially in tasks requiring intricate, multi-step decision-making. For a deeper dive into ToT and its applications, see the original research by [Yao et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601) and [DeepAI’s overview](https://deepai.org/publication/tree-of-thoughts-deliberate-problem-solving-with-large-language-models).

## 8. ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)

**ReAct** is a prompting framework that combines reasoning and action, allowing large language models (LLMs) to interleave verbal reasoning with actionable steps. This approach is particularly useful for tasks that require interaction with external environments or tools, like navigating websites, fact-checking, or even more complex interactive decision-making processes. By alternating between generating reasoning traces and taking specific actions, ReAct allows models to dynamically adjust their plans based on new observations, enhancing both accuracy and flexibility.

### How ReAct Works

The **ReAct** framework stands out because it enables models to do more than just reason in isolation. Traditional approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) allow models to perform step-by-step reasoning, but they are limited to internal representations of knowledge, which can lead to hallucinations or outdated information. In contrast, ReAct integrates reasoning with interaction: models can both reason about a task and perform actions to gather new information from external sources, such as a search engine or API. For example, when answering a question, the model might first reason that it needs specific information, then perform a search action to retrieve relevant data, and finally update its reasoning to produce a refined answer.

### Programmatic Implementation

ReAct is particularly effective when used programmatically in systems that need LLMs to interface with external environments. For example, in applications like **web navigation** or **fact verification**, ReAct allows models to alternate between planning actions (such as looking up information or navigating websites) and adjusting reasoning based on feedback from those actions. The system will prompt the LLM to perform both reasoning and actions as separate steps, gathering observations along the way and dynamically adjusting its approach based on the new data.

This interleaving of reasoning and acting is also crucial for improving **interpretability** and **trustworthiness**. Since reasoning traces are exposed, users can inspect the model's thought process at every step, making it easier to diagnose issues or even intervene mid-task to correct the model’s trajectory.

### Use Cases and Effectiveness

ReAct has demonstrated strong performance across a variety of tasks, particularly in **knowledge-intensive** areas like question answering (e.g., [HotpotQA](https://hotpotqa.github.io/)) and **fact verification** (e.g., [FEVER](https://fever.ai/dataset/fever.html)). Additionally, it has shown superior results in decision-making benchmarks like [ALFWorld](https://alfworld.github.io/) and [WebShop](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/webshop), where it significantly outperformed acting-only or reasoning-only baselines by integrating both approaches into a seamless problem-solving pipeline.

By alternating between reasoning and acting steps, ReAct is better suited for tasks that involve real-time decisions or require the model to adapt based on new information. Moreover, it addresses the limitations of reasoning frameworks that operate solely on static knowledge, making it a valuable tool for environments where external information needs to be continually integrated into the model’s reasoning.

For a more detailed analysis, see the original research paper: ["ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models" (Yao et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629).

## 9. PLANSEARCH

**PLANSEARCH** is a framework designed to enhance AI reasoning by breaking down complex tasks into distinct phases of **planning** and **searching**. This approach allows AI systems to map out potential paths toward a solution before committing to specific actions, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring long-term reasoning and adaptation. PLANSEARCH can be seen as a forward-looking method for improving how AI navigates complex environments by organizing the decision-making process into structured steps that involve both exploration and execution.

### How PLANSEARCH Works

In PLANSEARCH, a model first generates a **plan**, which outlines the high-level steps needed to solve a given problem. After this planning phase, the model initiates a **search** process to explore different possible solutions or actions that align with the plan. This separation allows the model to focus on the "what" (planning) and the "how" (searching) in a more efficient and goal-oriented way. The result is a model capable of dynamically adjusting its path based on real-time feedback or changes in the environment, making it highly suitable for complex problem-solving【25†source】.

### Comparison with Tree of Thought (ToT) and ReAct

While **Tree of Thought (ToT)** and **ReAct** also emphasize structured decision-making, they approach it differently:

- **ToT** uses a decision tree-like structure, exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously and evaluating each branch to determine the best course of action. It focuses heavily on **exploring** various thoughts in parallel before selecting the most viable one, relying on backtracking and pruning to refine its approach【5†source】【6†source】.

- **ReAct** integrates reasoning with actionable steps, alternating between **reasoning traces** and **actions**. The model dynamically interacts with external environments (like APIs or search engines) to gather information and adjust its reasoning based on real-world feedback, making it highly interactive【22†source】【23†source】.

- **PLANSEARCH**, on the other hand, separates the **planning** and **searching** phases. This allows it to excel in situations where long-term, goal-oriented thinking is required, as it can adjust both its plan and the specific search paths it explores. It offers a more structured approach to problems requiring careful planning over many stages, making it a strong candidate for highly complex, multi-step tasks【25†source】【9†source】.

### Use Cases and Applications

Like ToT and ReAct, PLANSEARCH is particularly useful for tasks that involve **long-term reasoning**, such as strategic planning, multi-stage problem-solving, and scenarios that involve interacting with dynamic environments. However, its distinct strength lies in its **dual-phase approach**, where the model can first plan out the sequence of tasks and then explore the best solutions within that plan.

For a deeper dive into the PLANSEARCH framework and its future applications in AI reasoning, you can read my full post here: [PLANSEARCH for LLMs](https://parastudios.de/plansearch-o1-models-future-ai-reasoning).

By integrating PLANSEARCH into the broader landscape of advanced prompting techniques, we gain a richer toolkit for building AI systems capable of handling increasingly complex reasoning and decision-making tasks.

## Conclusion

While these prompting techniques remain effective for both ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5, it's important to note that these advanced LLMs are increasingly capable of understanding and responding to natural language instructions. Often, clear and concise prompts can yield excellent results without resorting to complex prompting strategies.

The key is to experiment with different approaches and find what works best for your specific use case. Remember, the most effective prompt is one that clearly communicates your intent and provides the necessary context for the model to generate accurate and relevant responses.

As LLMs continue to advance, we can expect prompting techniques to evolve as well. Stay curious, keep experimenting, and don't be afraid to engage these AI models in increasingly sophisticated ways!
